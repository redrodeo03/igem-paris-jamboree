Assa-cin: Controlling bacterial plant pathogens through a modular microcin expression system,"Plant pathogens pose a serious threat to agriculture, causing around $220 billion in global crop damages annually. Our project aims to fight bacterial plant pathogens using microcins, an emerging class of antimicrobial peptides that many bacterial species secrete as a weapon for interspecies competition. To protect crops from bacterial pathogens, we engineered a modular system for secreting microcins from a plant symbiont to kill a target pathogen. Our system utilizes two plasmids. The first encodes the secretion system proteins required for export of the microcins. The second plasmid expresses the microcin and its immunity protein which confers resistance to microcin toxicity. This modular and easily reprogrammable system can potentially protect crops from a broad range of bacterial plant pathogens. Overall, we identified novel microcins in the genomes of plant pathogens, cloned examples from three different pathogen families, and tested the effectiveness of 9 identified microcins against onion pathogens.
