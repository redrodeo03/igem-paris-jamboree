Existing techniques pose limitations, as they do not combine effective, economical and rapid detection. The Cellock Holmes project aims to tackle these challenges all at once. By combining native microbial sensing systems, such as quorum sensing, with open source biology, hardware and software, a novel two-dimensional biosensor is developed. Cellock HolmesÂ’ simple, modular and open design enables the end user to test solid surfaces for microbial contamination without any expensive equipment or highly trained personnel. The working concept is demonstrated using one of the most prevalent human pathogens, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. The versatile biosensing system, however, can be easily customized to detect other pathogens as well.  ",2014

But as agreed on by various nations, we have to become independent from fossil resources during the next decades. As a consequence, not only fuels, but many other products including drugs, fine chemicals and plastic will have to be produced from renewable carbon sources. In parallel, we observe arable land per capita shrinking and more frequent droughts. But even by increasing agricultural productivity, plants will not be able to meet our massive demands. Therefore, we are developing an alternative route to sustainably produce complex carbon which significantly reduces the space and water needs. By using new synthetic pathways, we are upcycling a simple, renewable chemical into a universal carbon source. ",2015

We are modifying the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to increase the uptake of various ions into the cell and store these inside its vacuole. This will be achieved by upregulation of native (vacuolar) ion importers and knock-out of ion exporters. Furthermore, we are expressing heterologous genes from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in yeast to improve vacuolar ion accumulation, thus creating a microbial dustbin.
With this newly generated library of genetically engineered yeasts, we hope to offer a novel way of treating water contaminated by industrial processes and store pollutants in our intracellular reservoir, the Salt Vault.

The ""Plastractor"" is a device which shall extract microplastics from fluids easily via magnets. Therefore the bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum ""magneticum"" was obtained. It is genetically modified to build magnetosomes; small magnetic and vesicle-like particles, with plastic binding peptides on its membrane. For modification we use E. coli BW29427 which transfers the needed plasmid to Rhodospirillum rubrum ""magneticum"" via conjugation. Two different plastic binding peptides are used, ""Tachystatin A2"" (TA2) and ""liquid chromatography peak I"" (LCI), fused with two different fluorescent proteins to enable the detection of the bound particles. Thus the device will be able to extract the plastics that are bound to magnetosomes and detect it by fluorescence.

We designed an efficient and stable CA by improving the catalytic performance of CA from thermophilic bacteria and the biological stability of capturing CO2. We use computer-aided analysis software to predict the ideal mutation site of the protein. Then we carried out enzyme-substrate molecular docking and enzyme-solvent kinetics simulation, constructed wild-type and mutant CA prokaryotic expression vectors, and expressed and purified the protein. Finally, we carried out functional identification to determine whether the activity of the mutant protein changed and whether the thermal stability was significantly improved.

Multiple databases, constraint-based programming and gene-protein-reaction associations are used to devise suitable strategies. These strategies are then optimized using pathfinding methods and sequence optimization. As proof-of-principle, we applied Forbidden FRUITS to salicylic acid, lactate and mannitol production in Synechocystis PCC6803, lactate in Synechococcus UTEX 2973 and salicylic acid in Escherichia Coli.

Nitrates can make their way into water bodies due to fertilizer use in agriculture or industrial activity. This creates an unpleasant smell and look and blocks sunlight from reaching marine life inside the water, killing plants and leading to the destruction of marine life. The foul smell can avert tourists, which can devastate small businesses that rely on seasonal income. This is why we are designing a filter to convert the nitrates into an indigestible form of nitrogen that canÂ’t be utilized by these microbes, stopping eutrophication. We will achieve this by expressing the gene responsible for the production of nitrate reductase in E. coli, and harvesting the enzymes. They will then be immobilized on a 3 layer water filter which can be installed in water drainage systems. We offer a solution to the problem of eutrophication.

However, the total cost of dNTPsÂ’ production is significant and they are often produced by complicated, unsustainable chemical processes, mainly feasible in centralized laboratories with expensive equipment. For this project, a high yield genetic circuit is designed in order to produce ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and thymidylate synthase (TSase), two enzymes necessary for the production of dNTPs. The produced dNTPs, along with thermostable Pfu DNA Polymerase, also included in the designed genetic circuit, allow for a low-cost PCR, with components not requiring cold storage.

Our system is built on a population scale to avoid the metabolic burden of a single-cell system by taking advantage of the natural ways bacteria communicate, i.e., exploiting bacterial quorum sensing signals, Acyl-Homoserine-Lactones, in E.Coli consortia. Ribosome Binding Site variants are used as plug-and-play devices to tune the weights, and a steep genetic activation function is built to engineer a living binary classifier.

Upon delivery, our sensing moiety (Toehold Riboswitch adjusted for mammalian systems) is constitutively expressed. If SARS-CoV-2 triggers are present within the cell, the sensor will unfold initiating a GAL4-VP16-dependent interference pathway. Consequently, we designed two de novo siRNAs that play a critical role in our antiviral therapeutic approach.

To protect crops from bacterial pathogens, we engineered a modular system for secreting microcins from a plant symbiont to kill a target pathogen. Our system utilizes two plasmids. The first encodes the secretion system proteins required for export of the microcins. The second plasmid expresses the microcin and its immunity protein which confers resistance to microcin toxicity. This modular and easily reprogrammable system can potentially protect crops from a broad range of bacterial plant pathogens.

One part of our project creates an Â“Expansion Pack Reporter KitÂ”.  This kit uses a fused fluorescent reporter, containing an N-terminal RFP domain, a C-terminal GFP domain, and an amber codon-containing linker sequence that connects the two domains.  While the RFP domain is translated and fluoresces under all conditions, the GFP domain is only translated when the ncAA is incorporated within the linker.  Failure to incorporate the ncAA leads to translation termination, and thus no GFP fluorescence.  This allows us to accurately assess the rate and fidelity of ncAA incorporation.

The ability to produce high amounts of designer EVs and a standard and specific purification methodology are still lacking. Here, we present a biological system to produce designer exosomes based on HEK293T cell line. Firstly, we have included a tag system to improve and simplify the collection and purification techniques. Furthermore, we have implemented a molecular device based on L7Ae:C/D-box interaction that permits the direct loading of shRNA-labelled molecules into exosomes inside the cell, avoiding the cumbersome process of artificial loading. Lastly, we pretend to validate our system by producing exosomes loaded with shRNA against myc to use them as an innovative therapy against Burkitt's lymphoma. ",2022

Traditional treatment to acne vulgaris involving antibiotics may trigger drug resistance in acne pathogenic bacteria, especially Propionibacterium. acnes. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered excellent alternatives of antibiotics for their capability of providing effective, broad-spectrum defenses against infections and exhibiting relatively low potential to elicit resistance. However, AMP curing products nowadays are not abundant, and most AMPs are produced via chemosynthesis, a rather costly method incapable of yielding AMPs with great antimicrobial potency. Therefore, we aim to create an anti-acne product which consists of biosynthesized P. acnes killing AMPs, adhesive/cohesive proteins, and tyrosinase. The mixture which we named Acneutralizer forms a thin film when applied to acne-infected skin.

We produced hormone-specific antibodies in E. coli and single chain variable fragments for comparison. Immobilized on the gold-coated surface of the crystal, antibody-antigen binding leads to a phase shift which is detected by the electronics and transferred to our user-friendly app. It tracks, evaluates and visualizes recent measurements, displaying the current fertility status.

Our plant indicates the presence of toxic chemicals by changing its color to red. For this, we introduce two new reporter systems called RUBY and ANTHOS, enabling the synthesis of the plant pigments betalains or anthocyanins, respectively. If the chemical is present, it is specifically bound by a receptor, which then activates a signaling cascade, resulting in the synthesis of the pigments. Both computational design and site-directed mutagenesis are used to design new receptor proteins.
In the future, our plant allows the detection of further chemicals by replacing the specific receptor.

",collegiate,Creative Tasting Officer,"   Taste is the soul of food. Food companies all over the world are looking for better ways to quantify the basic flavors of newly developed food products. In the food industry, human sensory panel and electronic tongue are most commonly used to evaluate taste. However, human sensory is costly and subjectively affected, while one electronic tongue cannot measure the taste of multiple food. This year BIT-China devotes to design a Creative Tasting Officer-a yeast cell biosensor to quantify the basic tastes of umami, sweetness and bitterness. Genetic circuits are designed to express human taste receptors heterologously in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the intensity of fluorescences would quantitively reflect the respective taste degree of food samples.  Furthermore, we develop a series of Soybean based Creative Seasonings and a Flavor Card Website to help people discover their favorite taste. Everyone can click the link and find the satisfying flavor with personalized color panel!!!",2021

Traditional chemical synthesis methods generate substantial industrial waste, posing environmental challenges. To address these issues, we have designed a yeast-based cell factory capable of environmentally-friendly, controllable fragrance production.

Our approach leverages the power of light regulation using a photosensitive transcription regulator, EL222, and a specific promoter, PC120. The 450nm light triggers the expression of essential genes for the synthesis of sclareol, while represses those for santalol. This dynamic photoinduction system offers advantages such as operational reversibility, high spatiotemporal resolution, and enhanced production efficiency.

Our experiments indicate that our cell factory can potentially produce fragrant bases with precise proportions of santalol and sclareol. This breakthrough promises a more sustainable and flexible future for fragrance production.",2023

A characteristic specific to solid tumors is Antigen-Heterogeneity on the surface. This property neutralizes antigen-specific treatments, like Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) - T therapy. To mitigate this problem, we propose a treatment which targets the adhesion mechanism of the tumor and disintegrates it. STAT3 inhibition, which focuses on this property, is thus exploited to aid CAR T-cell treatment. This treatment is centered on the drug Honokiol which inhibits STAT3. The drug is extracellularly displayed on T-cells via a modified Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (CB1) construct, and is to be released by the CB1 antagonist AM-6538 near the tumor site, thus minimizing side-effects of both CAR T and the drug. The treatment therefore expands the utility of CAR T therapy while also introducing genetically modified vectors as agents of drug delivery.",2023

To further enhance the tumor targeting ability, we had genetically modified VNP20009 to express single chain antibody fragments on the outer membrane. Once the engineered bacteria reached the tumor tissue, it will secrete glucose oxidase into the tumor cells, mediating the occurrence of the Fenton reaction. Additionally, the engineered bacteria express shRNAs to silence the SLC7A11, leading to a reduction in glutathione levels and inactivation of GPX4. All above strategies facilitate lipid peroxidation and promote ferroptosis in the tumor cells. To ensure safety, we have implemented a toxin-antitoxin system to maintain plasmid stability and prevent horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, doxycycline administration induces self-destruction of the engineered bacteria at the end of the treatment.

Insufficient control of contaminations in bioreactors could compromise entire batches, resulting in high expenses. Team Chalmers Gothenburg will solve the contamination problem once and for all using a novel strategy to detect and combat contaminations in yeast based bioreactors. The solution involves two genetic systems, one signaling and contamination detection system and one repair system for survival after contamination termination. These two systems are made from innovative uses of ESDSA repair, CRISPR technology and MAPK cascades. The two systems also set the foundation for a whole range of new applications, from DNA assembly to laboratory markers. More will be revealed in this study in scarlet.",2015

Specific Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC)s are molecules that have been found in the breath of lung cancer patients. 

In our project we are creating a biosensor for two of these VOCs. Receptors natively present in the membrane of yeast are replaced with xenogeneic receptors that are able to recognize the VOCs. When the VOCs are sensed the pheromone pathway is initiated and a detection system triggered, ultimately leading to that the yeast cells turns red through interruption of the ADE2 gene.

Traditional chemical synthesis methods produce low yields of these compounds, which contribute to expensive market prices for the medications that require them. Finding a cheaper, alternative route of synthesizing these chemicals through synthetic biology would help make a biological solution for myopia more affordable and accessible.

Current treatments against this bacteria are based on the use of antibiotics or faecal transplants. The latter, potentially disgusting for patients. As for the antibiotics, only few are effective and, after treatment, patients can present a recurrent infection. Therefore, there is an urge to find alternative treatments to CDI. 
We propose a system based on the insertion of genetic constructs into Lactobacillus casei, which will act as a probiotic.

The honeybee, Apis mellifera, is an important pollinator that is suffering from a crisis called Colony Collapse Disorder.

Using this technique, the midgut bacteria of the bee are engineered to express a cytochrome p450, rendering the bee resistant to the insecticide. By attaching the reporter phoA to the insecticide-resistance gene, CYP6AY1, found in Nilaparvata lugens, the expression of the protein can be monitored. The signal sequence pelB is used to secrete the protein into the bee gut, where it can metabolize the imidacloprid. Once this system successfully functions in-vitro, the transgenic bacteria can be introduced to the bee orally and monitored for significant effects. We hypothesize that this treatment will increase the survival rate of A. mellifera when exposed to imidacloprid. ",2019

Oxybenzone contributes to coral bleaching by accumulating in coral tissues and reducing sunlight availability for photosynthetic organisms due to its UV-absorbing properties. Through the genetic engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, oxybenzone concentration levels in water bodies can be detected. The estrogenic properties of oxybenzone allow it to bind to a synthetic fusion protein containing a human estrogen receptor which will result in the expression of the LacZ gene. This causes the enzyme beta-galactosidase to be produced and breakdown its substrate. This produces an electrochemical signal which can be measured using the Field-Ready Electrochemical Detector (FRED) and analyzed to determine oxybenzone concentration. This will allow for greater understanding of the issue of coral bleaching, and provide a tool to assess the impact of further steps being taken to protect these aquatic ecosystems.",2021

Today, the world population is only sustainable if ammonia-rich fertilizers are used to increase crop production. However, fertilizer is an environmental hazard due to the extensive release of carbon dioxide. Also, fertilizer runoff causes algae populations to grow faster than the ecosystem can handle, creating oxygen-depleted dead zones within the ocean. 

Due to growing environmental concerns, genetically engineering plants to contain the bacterial enzyme, nitrogenase, may allow plants to become self-fertilizing.

It affects many pregnancies globally, and although most women survive preeclampsia, untreated it can lead to severe complications, and even death. Despite extensive research, there is, unfortunately, no reliable treatment for preeclampsia. The goal of this project is to produce an effective theoretical siRNA treatment, PreeclampsiRNA, using recombinant lentiviral vectors to carry and deliver shRNA to the trophoblast to inhibit the translation of soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFlt1-14), an antiangiogenic pseudo-receptor that captures placental growth factor (PlGF) and prevents it from binding the proper receptor, which would signal for angiogenesis. We would test several different shRNA sequences to see which causes the most effective reduction of sFlt1-14. By degrading the mRNA of sFlt1-14 using siRNA, we aim to reduce the placental levels of this molecule (which is overproduced in preeclamptic patients, leading to hypertension) and thus alleviate symptoms.

W decided to investigate a noninvasive method: VOC (volatile organic compound) detection using a breath test. Our goal is to use the K-12 strain of E. coli bacteria that will produce a quantifiable color change in response to the presence of a VOC. Using published research, we identified a set of VOCs whose concentration in the breath is higher in lung cancer patients: propanol, trimethylbenzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene, hexanal, acetone, and isoprene [2]. We will insert promoters that are induced by these VOCs into plasmids and a GFP gene that will produce a color change, transforming E. coli with these plasmids. This product would be implemented as a test that could use one breath sample to detect the levels of 8 separate VOCs.

But CRISPR-based genome engineering strategies have off-target cleaves, variable gRNA efficiency, protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) specificity and other problems. These hinder us obtaining strains that are accurately edited, prolonging the time of strain construction and screening, costing more manpower and materials. Here, we developed a CRISPR-based purification system Â“strainerÂ”, which utilizes double stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) as a signal to start the transcription of gRNA targeting on the plasmid harboring inducible toxic gene SacB. Then, only the strain with DSBs and recombineering can survive in the media with sucrose, because SacB converts sucrose to levan that is toxic to E. coli, thereby improving the overall editing efficiency during the genome engineering process. We then applied Â“strainerÂ” for an isopropanol high-producing strain construction efficiently. Â“StrainerÂ” can be potentially used as an universal method for cell factory construction.

This step is performed using Recombinase Polymerase Amplification, an isothermal nucleic acid amplification method. The created amplicons are transcribed into mRNA and bind to a toehold sensor, thus activating a reporter gene. Once this gene is translated, it produces catechol 2,3 dioxygenase which reacts with catechol and creates a colorimetric feedback.

Many bacterial systems currently rely on external stimuli to induce transcription. One dimensional protocols often require constant monitoring of applied chemical concentrations, leading to them becoming inept for more complex systems.  A triplet of NOT gated photoreceptors in Escherichia coli, will be used to create a system which is finely controlled using only light. This will be showcased using magenta, cyan and yellow pigments as outputs. Varying the intensity and wavelength of light projected onto E. coli will control the shade and colour produced, respectively. Hence, this will show the versatility of the optical control by creating a full colour bio-camera. Additionally, using bacteria to produce an image vastly increases the resolution when compared to conventional cameras, due to the micrometre scale of bacteria.",2013

It consists of autologous isolated T cells modified with a chimeric receptor based on the T-cell receptor combined with the recognition domain of an antibody. Upon reinjection, CAR T-cells exhibit cytotoxicity with high affinity towards cells displaying the antigen. However, clinical trials have shown that as tumor antigens are not solely expressed on tumor cells, but also on healthy tissues, grave off-target effects like the Graft-versus-Host-Disease may occur.
In order to avoid such side-effects, we engineer CAR T-cell lines specifically activated by factors of the tumor microenvironment. Controlled by a genetic AND-gate system the T cells need two input signals in order to express CAR. This would allow highly localized cytotoxic activity of T cells and provide safer cell-based cancer immunotherapy especially for solid tumors.

We aimed to engineer and compare different compartmentalization systems (rigid shells and liquid droplets) for their ability to localize enzymes and promote metabolic processes due to reduced formation of toxic side-products and more efficient interplay between pathway components thanks to physical proximity. Using computational structural biology, we predicted sites at which the incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) could influence pore size. To facilitate the use of ncAAs for future iGEM teams, we developed INCLUSIVE, a database collecting the important information from the literature. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of genome reduction on compartment formation and metabolic pathway output. In conclusion, our project lays the foundations for using compartmentalization as a tool to exploit the full power of bacterial cells.

Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola has been found to affect legumes specifically by producing the phytotoxin phaseolotoxin. Our team plans to replicate the phaseolotoxin production pathway in Escherichia coli and utilize the toxin as a more environmentally friendly option to remove kudzu. After the removal of kudzu, local endangered species can regrow without competition. Additionally, we developed three models to simulate the spread of infectious plant diseases like Asian Soybean Rust using kudzu as a vector, simulate the ROTCase production and activity under promoters with different strengths, and predict the spread and management cost of kudzu in a local area.

To better understand this problem, we will assess the potential risk of lateral transfer of E. coli plasmids by T4 bacteriophages under different conditions. We have shown that T4 can transfer plasmid DNA, which does increase the risk of lateral transfer. However, the number of E. coli phages present in our local environment appears to be quite low, reducing the risk. We added four new T4 early promoters to the registry to support our project.

This was why the splicing was hard to happen because two sequences to act as ribozyme for splicing were far each other. So we incorporated <b>complementary sequences</b> around the ribozyme regions. We thought that the treatment brought two regions close and the efficiency of the circularization improved.<br>

However, many Japanese neglect the excessive stress that can cause depression and other problems. We assume this is due to the difficulty of quantitative measurement of stress and that patients cannot be diagnosed by appearance whether they are suffering or not. Human Herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) is a virus that infects 90% of humans in childhood and has the characteristic that it can remain latently in the human body for a lifetime. It has been reported that fatigue over a period of about a week reactivates the virus and is detected in saliva. Accordingly, we decided to create a system to quantify HHV-6 by using CRISPR based DETECTR assay (2018 Doudna et al.), based on our idea that the amount of the virus in saliva can be correlated with the stage of medium-term stress.

Since adhesiveness is correlated with L-DOPA content, our project aims to improve the adhesive properties of MAPs by utilizing a strain which inserts the non-canonical amino acid L-DOPA at UAG stop codons during translation. When combined with the in vivo production of free L-DOPA, this system is a significant step towards rapid, cost-effective MAPs production.

Nonetheless, the concept of inducible gene expression is often difficult for students to understand. To help students gain a better understanding of inducible gene expression, we developed ""BactoArt"", a multicomponent, inducible expression system that allows students to visualize gene regulation in action.
First, different fluorescent protein (FP) color variants (e.g., CFP, GFP, or RFP) were placed under the control of specific inducible promoters. The inducers can then be patterend onto a petri dishÂ—using either a paintbrush or an inkjet printerÂ—before plating BactoArt bacteria, leading to selective induction of a given FP. We simultaneously induced GFP and RFP from pXyl and pLac, respectively, and measured their fluorescence intensity over time. We believe that such hands-on activities will spark questions, leading to ""teachable moments"" about transcriptional regulation.

We will assemble new NRPSs by combining individual domains and modules of different origin, thus setting the basis for novel and customized synthesis of non-ribosomal peptides. To make the use of NRPSs amenable to a wider community, we will devise a new software-tool, called Â“NRPS DesignerÂ”, which predicts the optimal modular composition of synthetic NRPSs for production of any desired peptide and outputs a cloning strategy based on Gibson assembly. 
 
As an application relevant to society, we will engineer <i>Escherichia coli</i> to recycle gold from electronic waste in a cost- and energy-efficient way through the heterologous expression of the NRPS pathway of <i>Delftia acidovorans</i> that naturally enables precipitation of gold ions from solution.

To combat this problem, the Antimicrobial Peptide Cecropin B (CecB),  a highly-effective, broad-spectrum antibiotic alternative is expressed in transgenic Chlorella autotrophica, a well-studied and highly-productive protein expressing microalgal chassis. It is expressed with a secretion signal peptide for extraction; and SUMO-tag for in-vitro cleavage using SUMO-protease. To validate efficacy, the isolated CecB is tested against common aquatic pathogens. The in-vitro cleavage system, barring the signal peptide, is also expressed using a bacterial chassis. This is to test the design and quantify the differences between microalgal and bacterial synthetic capabilities. To modify the system for industrial use, the signal peptide is removed and the SUMO-protease is additionally inserted, under a nitrogen-starvation inducible promoter, to cleave SUMO in-vivo and generate active AMPs. The microalgae are then freeze-dried, preserving active AMPs internally, which can then be used as supplemental feed.

The degradation rate of PET is significantly slow which make them extremely persistent and hard to dispose. Although PETase can biologically degrade PET, the rate of enzymatic reaction is not suitable for usage in plastic waste treatment. Therefore, creating mutants which have a higher PET degradation activity may represent an effective and a long term solution of pollution from PET. After structural studies of PETase and its mutants, we hypothesized a more hydrophobic surface and narrower substrate binding site could lead to an increase in activity due to a better substrate interaction with PET. In our study, four single or double PETase mutants are produced and their PET degrading capacity are measured by enzyme activities for para-nitrophenol (pNP)-aliphatic esters. ",2019

However, this comes along with heavy financial burden to developing or underdeveloped countries. In addition, almost all these drugs have side effects to liver and renal.
  Here is a novel method to treat Hypertension by constructing human-friendly engineering bacteria that can produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) periodically and naturally to help maintain the blood pressure in safe level.
  SCFA, especially acetate and propionate, has been proved to induce vasodilatation and ensuing hypotensive response via receptors in smooth muscle cells of vessels. This year we have found a metabolic pathway in Escherichia coli that converts succinate to propionate through Wood-Werkman reaction. An operon consisting four genes encodes enzymes in this pathway. By combining bio-oscillator and key gene together, we want to make E. Coli release propionate periodically in patientsÂ’ intestine periodically.

",collegiate,EDC-Seas: development of an enzymatic degradation system of dibutyl phthalate involving cellulosome-based immobilization.,"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) present in water have recently raised concerns about their negative impact on human and animal health. Phthalates, which belong to the EDCs, are widely used in industry as plasticizers, improving the mechanical properties of plastic materials. However, they can be released from materials to the environment and reach drinking water, where their concentrations often exceed the limits set by the WHO as safe. In response to the problem of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) pollution, we came up with the idea of a protein complex capable of efficient degradation of those pollutants. Based on literature, we designed a system consisting of enzymes fused to dockerin domains that enable binding to scaffoldin, which facilitates immobilization to cellulose. We expect that the resulting engineered proteins will make it possible to create a cell-free water filtration system which will degrade phthalates to easily biodegradable benzoic acid.",2023

Causing millions of deaths per year all over the world, the number keeps rising to a predicted 10 million deaths in 2050. It is mainly due to our over-consumptions through the years. But for now, no technological solution exists, and no new antibiotics have yet been discovered. 
To avoid this disaster, the INSA-ENS-Lyon1 team created SuperBugBuster, a project and a tool capable of removing resistance from bacteria. Based on two different approaches: CRISPR-cas9 and Bac-PROTAC systems, it permits an innactivation of a targeted resistant gene and the degradation of the associated proteins. The project construction also includes creating software to design CRISPR-cas9 RNA guide genes and important work on human practices and education of society, which is the core and the beginning of the issue of antibiotic resistance.

Our project, FIAT LUX, based on an improved version of the luxCDABE operon ilux, aims at simplifying the use of luminescence as a reporter gene, notably for in vivo infection studies. It enables the tracking of luminescent bacterial spread in tissues, without having to sample or kill the host.

Overexpression of four genes from the hem family leads to the accumulation of 5-ALA, a precursor for the photosensitizer PpIX. Subsequently, rhtA, an exporter also expressed by IRIS, transports 5-ALA into cancer cells, resulting in the accumulation of PpIX.

Firstly, exogenous alpha-pinene monooxygenase was introduced into E. coli to facilitate the oxidation of alpha-pinene into alpha-pinene oxidate. Then, alpha-pinene oxidate can be converted into isonovalal by E. coli introduced with alpha-pinene oxide lyase. We intend to apply our engineering bacteria to the real world.

To address inadequate oxygen during wound healing, we coupled the VHb promoter to a downstream gene encoding FGF. The VHb promoter is activated at an oxygen threshold below 2%, inducing transcription of the FGF gene in response to hypoxic conditions.

When the extracellular environment lacks of oxygen, a plasmid in Nissle 1917 can express invasin and Hyl proteins, making the Nisssle 1917 invade into tumor cells, and avoid cell lysosomes endocytosis. After the Nissle 1917 enter solid tumor cells, another plasmid will express TAT protein, inducing cell apoptosis.

D-glutamate-rich &#947;-PGA is industrially produced by natural strain Bacillus species. D-glutamate degrades more slowly and L- glutamate has better biocompatibility. Therefore, &#947;-PGA with tailored L/D glutamate ratio is demanded for more diverse applications. By constructing the biobricks of &#947;-PGA synthase complex, 0.696 g/L L-glutamate-rich &#947;-PGA was accumulated in Corynebacterium glutamicum. Using the mathematical models based on the fermentation profile, the fermentation was optimized, and 15 times more &#947;-PGA was produced than that before. By introducing glutamate racemase gene racE under different Ptac promoter mutants, the L-glutamic acid content in &#947;-PGA varies from 97.1% to 36.9%. Finally, we devoted to fine tune the D/L-monomer ratio using standarized RBS elements (RBS modified with bicistron design). Our project provides a method for customerized polymer biosynthesis with precisely controlled D/L ratio, and may expand to other biopolymer synthesis.

In Sri Lanka, it affects the livelihood of 1.8 million farmers and the lack of proper post-harvest technology is costing them 2393 million dollars annually. The fungi that are present in the storage of rice are Aspergillus spp. In this project, we establish a stringent post-harvest management system for rice by measuring the concentration of aflatoxin B1, a toxin produced by Aspergillus spp. To measure the concentration of AFB1, we used the enzyme, cytochrome P450 1A2. Reactions between AFB1 and CYP1A2 result in compounds with epoxide residue, which can be used for the detection. Here, we also proposed a nonparametric MARS model designed to capture possible inter-dependent effects of environmental factors on fungal infection of stored rice.

Considering the limitations of current mediums, an alternative method for data storage has been proposed: storing data in DNA which is more cost and space efficient. Binary data is encoded into nucleotide bases. However, DNA, when exposed to stress factors deforms, leading to lost or altered data in DNA; thus, methods to ensure the stability of DNA are critical to implementing DNA data storage. We hypothesized that forming Transcription Factor A Mitochondria (TFAM)-DNA complex in an aqueous solution supports DNA stability during data storage and retrieval. TFAM preserves DNA inside the mitochondria, acting as an adequate stabilizer. The TFAM-DNA complex was created with replicated human lung cDNA and purified TFAM protein. This complex was able to maintain stability in conditions with various stress factors, suggesting that DNA can be a viable method to store data.

Biosensors have been developed before but the tunability is mostly low, despite being fundamental for a broad application. The safety of biosensors also remains a hurdle to entering the clinics. Therefore, our goal is to develop a dose-dependent biosensor using NarX-NarL two-component nitrate sensing system and a naringenin responsive promotor in E. coli as a proof-of-concept. Temperature-sensitive riboswitches and a type II toxin-antitoxin system are used to establish biocontainment. To support and guide biosensor development, modeling is done to predict the threshold needed. The final goal is to combine these two genetic circuits in Lactobacillus spp., which is part of the gut microbiome, and to replace fluorescence with drug allowing therapy with fewer side effects.

We then engineered yeast which express dsRNA targeting these genes, with the goal of feeding the engineered yeast to the nematodes to knock down their genes (feeding RNAi). Furthermore, we predict that engineered yeast may be used to colonize healthy pines, functioning as a preventive measure against nematode infestation.

Our project aims to capture microfibers from household washing machines.

We designed encapsulins which display proteins binds to plastic and microorganisms found in wastewater treatment plants. We picked up some proteins as plastic-binding proteins, and compared them with each other. In our strategy, microfibers may then be bound to microorganisms through engineered encapsulins and settled in sedimentation basins.

Currently, subcutaneous injection of recombinant insulin is used to self-regulate abnormal blood glucose levels, a treatment that is painful and often prohibitively expensive for patients. Oral insulin alternatives are not yet a cost-effective alternative because the unprotected insulin is rapidly degraded by acidic stomach conditions and so there remains an unmet demand for low-cost methods of manufacturing oral insulin and/or novel methods for delivering insulin directly to the intestines. We are developing an edible recombinant microalgae strain called Â“AlgulinÂ” that produces either an ultrastable oral insulin analog or proinsulin peptides. Algulin reduces manufacturing costs by eliminating the need for insulin extraction and purification, improves efficacy over previous oral insulins by acting as a protective capsule and shielding the insulin from degradation, and eliminates uncomfortable injections for diabetic patients.

Hydrogen gas detection is notoriously challenging, being odourless, colourless and explosive at low concentrations (4%). From the canary in the coal mine, to the advanced gas detection equipment available today, the reliable detection of dangerous gas leaks remains of paramount importance. Hydrogen gas detectors are prone to cross-sensitivity due to the presence of other gases interfering with the measurement. Team HyDRA designed a highly specific hydrogen gas biosensor using Escherichia coli, containing a NiFe hydrogenase, cyclic-di-GMP riboswitch and cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase. We designed this system to produce a fluorescent signal upon the detection of sufficient hydrogen gas to be considered a safety threat (40,000 ppm). Consultations with fire rescue, gas production and pipeline industries have guided us to design a prototype, resulting in a safe, reliable and efficient alternative method for quantifying hydrogen gas.",2019

Currently, diagnosis for MDD includes the DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria, however, there is a need for a risk assessment tool to complement this. Cross-sectional studies show significant differences in the gut microbiota composition between healthy individuals and MDD patients. Of particular interest are the dysregulated bacterial metabolites butyrate, GABA, butyrate, and indole, which have profound effects on the development and progression of MDD, and have a distinct metabolic signature that can be used to profile individuals as having a greater risk for MDD. As such, our team designed a two-cell consortium tri-input biosensor that can assess the levels of each metabolite independently, while also using logic gates to predict overall risk for MDD. Mathematical models of the biosensor were used to validate our system further and identify the systemÂ’s sensitivity to baseline concentrations.

Upon detection of hypoxia and low pH, known tumour microenvironment markers, C12 will be released by the bacteria containing our genetically engineered circuit to act as: (1) a cytotoxic agent that induces cancer cell death, and (2) a signalling molecule that coordinates actions between bacterial colonies. Furthermore, the quorum sensing properties of C12 have been manipulated to activate a kill mechanism that arrests bacterial growth upon destruction of the tumour and the ensuing loss of its microenvironment. Thus, we propose constructing a genetic circuit that not only removes tumours, but also self-regulates itself to mitigate the risk of bacterial infection in the absence of cancerous cells.",2017

After numerous iterations, with an initial focus on the West Nile virus sequence, Cas13a protein, and guide RNA, we proudly introduce the prototype of this cutting-edge system. This versatile model forms the basis for detecting a range of pathogens, including diseases like dengue and chikungunya. By harnessing the extraordinary specificity of Cas13a and guide RNA, our innovation facilitates precise identification of pathogenic nucleic acids within mosquito samples. This breakthrough has the potential to redefine pathogen detection, providing a potent tool for epidemiologists and researchers in their ongoing battle against mosquito-borne diseases. With further refinements and expansions, this technology holds the promise of significantly enhancing public health efforts.

In northern climates with fluctuating sunlight levels, vitamin D insufficiency (< 50 nmol/L) is common. In Canada, 33% of the population experiences insufficiency. Current testing methods in northern British Columbia, Canada, are expensive, time-consuming, and inaccessible. A benchtop vitamin D biosensor that can be implemented in local healthcare facilities would address this problem. Our biosensor will detect vitamin D (25(OH)D) in a blood serum sample. The biosensor is contained in E. coli, and consists of two components: (i) 1-alpha-hydroxylase, and (ii) a chimeric protein consisting of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of vitamin D receptor and a FRET system (VDR-FRET). The 1-alpha-hydroxylase activates 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D, which has high affinity for the VDR-LBD. Binding of 1,25(OH)2D to the VDR-FRET protein results in an altered fluorescent signal.

Sequence alignment analysis showed that c-APOL3 lacked 38 residues in N-terminus and had differences in C-terminus domain. Further, structure prediction analysis via HHPred and RaptorX indicated that the N-terminus might interact with the C-terminus to maximize pore-forming potential in the b-APOL1, though c-APOL3 lacked these interactions.

Our aim is to use the Cre-Lox recombinase system to trigger a heritable genetic switch that allows for irreversible ON/OFF programming as an alternative to positive feedback loops. We are testing different approaches relying on the inversion and excision of lox-flanked DNA parts. Our long term goal is to integrate this system with signals from quorum sensing and a logic gate to program conditional chemotaxis in motile E. coli.,2015

Using the Drosophila gut as our model host and E.coli as our microbiome component, we developed techniques to engineer the gut microbiome. The E. coli was engineered to fluoresce GFP or RFP when induced by arabinose, its localization in the gut confirmed by fluorescent microscopy of dissected gut. To increase uptake of e. coli, it was mixed with bakerÂ’s yeast, thus coexistence of 3 species was required to deliver the bacteria to fly gut, When continuously fed, the bacteria remained in the gut, but removing bacteria from food led to a gut residence time of E. coli of 24 hours. The work showed the resistance of the host to establish a foreign persistent microbiome; future work would involve engineering a more native bacterial species such as Lactobacillus to increase gut residence time.

After 30, muscle decline is steady, reaching up to 50% by 70, resulting in disability and mortality. Globally, 50 million people suffer from sarcopenia, projected to rise to 500 million by 2050.
No FDA-approved drugs exist; treatments rely on exercise, diet, and often side-effect-ridden hormone therapy. The sarcopenia treatment market, valued at $2.577 billion in 2020, is projected to hit $4.704 billion by 2030, growing at 6.1% annually.
Our vision involves Live Biotherapeutic Products (LBPs), using genetically modified bacteria and yeast to produce muscle-enhancing compounds. These LBPs colonize the intestines, serving as probiotics and influencing metabolism.
Recent research underscores the gut microbiota's role in muscle health, making the gut a promising target for sarcopenia therapy. Our LBP holds potential in this context, offering hope for a more effective approach to combating this debilitating condition.

Using this chitinase, M. oryzae is able to avoid triggering the rice's defense mechanism that would inhibit the spread of the fungal infection. However, by preemptively exposing the rice plant to chitin it is possible to trigger the riceÂ’s defense mechanisms before M. oryzae can suppress detection methods. In order to accomplish this, we worked to develop a method of exposing rice plants to chitin by introducing NodC, a chitin synthase homolog, into Pseudomonas fluorescens, a bacterium that naturally lives on rice leaves.

We will generate genetically encoded FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensors by fusing the N- and C-termini of phosphate-binding protein (PBP), potassium-binding protein (KBP), PTH 1 receptor (PTH1R), and &#945;-Klotho to fluorescent proteins (FPs). To quantify physiologically relevant levels of phosphate, potassium, PTH and FGF23, highly optimized mNeonGreen and mCherry will be used as the FPs. Site-directed mutagenesis will be employed on protein-fluorophore constructs to add a Cysteine residue, to which a glutamate (E)/ lysine (K) coiled-coil system will be added to immobilize the construct onto a microfluidic surface. Through frequent monitoring and early disease detection, we hope to revolutionize CKD diagnostics. ",2020

These compounds are among the most industrially viable biosurfactants. As surfactants, sophorolipids are superior to current synthetic alternatives largely due to their low toxicity and ready biodegradability. Anti-cell proliferation and anti-microbial assays suggest that medium-chain length sophorolipids possess therapeutic potential. However, their higher cost of production poses a major barrier to commercial use. Even when grown on a substrate largely composed of fatty acids, a significant portion of the fatty acids are diverted from sophorolipid production due to competition with the &#946;-oxidation pathway. Fatty acids diverted into the &#946;-oxidation pathway undergo irregular cleavage, lowering sophorolipid yield and creating a heterogeneous mixture of products. Full suppression of this pathway would result in undesirable metabolic disruption. Selective suppression of this pathway through genetic engineering could reduce production costs through improving the yield of useful chain lengths.

Yeast cell factory has been widely applied in practical production. However, multiple stress challenges(such as high temperature and extreme pH environments) during the fermentation process significantly reduce its availability. Enhancing its tolerance can substantially reduce production costs and energy consumption, expanding the application scope of yeast cell factories. Polyamines, a class of widely distributed organic compounds derived from primary metabolic pathways, are associated with many stress-related phenotypes. Inspired by the relationship between polyamines and stress tolerance in plants and extremophiles, in YEAST PATRONUS, we utilized polyamine metabolism to construct a thermotolerant yeast cell factory.

Therefore we propose an alternative to antibodies; peptide aptamers Â– produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The variable loop of the peptide aptamer is generated through a random nucleotide library and held together by an enzymatic inactive version of human Thioredoxin (hThx) as a scaffold protein. We are using the bacterial two-hybrid system to screen for functioning peptide aptamers that are able to bind our chosen target proteins (Â‘antigensÂ’). In this model bacteria expressing a functioning peptide aptamer will express Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP), which enables us to isolate them.

In order to solve this problem, ShanghaiTech_China designed a new detection system -- CESAR (Cas12a-based Efficient Solution to Antibiotic-Resistance), to identify antibiotic-residue and ARGs.
CESAR contains two devices with different purposes:
(1) CESAR-I is a portable rapid-response device for on-site antibiotic-residue detection. By integrating the aptamer-sensing module, Cas12a-reporting module, and fluorescence-measuring module, it simplifies the process and lowers the cost of antibiotic-abuse surveillance.

This phenomenon is called antimicrobial resistance, or AMR.  As current diagnostic devices are not fast enough, this has resulted in the overprescription of antibiotics, leading to an increase in AMR. The aim of our project, BrightBiotics, was to create a cheap, rapid and user-friendly way to faster advise healthcare professionals, on what antibiotics to use. Our device, the BrightBiotics System, does this by measuring bacterial growth, as turbidity, in the presence of different antibiotics. Once the patientÂ’s sample has been prepared and put in the device, photodiodes detect changes in turbidity, and the data is sent via WiFi to the Cloud. The healthcare professionals can then check the results allowing them to make a more informed decision about which antibiotic to give the patient.",2017

There are already some methods to convert saltwater into freshwater, such as distillation and reverse osmosis. However, the high energy consumption of these technologies has limited their application. Therefore the development of an innovative, low-energy biological desalination process, by biological membranes of cyanobacteria, would be very attractive. Many cyanobacteria possess salt-tolerance mechanisms, among which sodium export is the most important one. Halorhodopsin is a light-driven inward-directed chloride pump from halobacteria. We will functionally express it in cyanobacteria to drive influx of chloride together with sodium, thus conferring cyanobacteria the ability to absorb salts to a significant degree. ",2015

Luminescence is displayed upon dCas9's binding to lure sequence using luciferase complementary assay. Our biostorage is based on CRISPR acquisition. Signal initiates Cas1/2 to insert protospacer into CRISPR array, further moving the predesigned stop codon out of frame and EGFP into the ORF.

These bacteriocins have shown effective inhibitory activity against MRSA strains; they form pores to penetrate the membrane of the pathogenic strain. We tested if the hybrid bacteriocins will have a synergistic effect and compared their cytotoxicity over time to that of the individual bacteriocins against MRSA. This was done by conducting two assays: minimum inhibitory concentration and the spot-on-lawn. Through development of hybrids, we aim to optimize the activity of bacteriocins and treat bacterial infections, particularly those with antibiotic resistance.",2017

Because the virus is spread between plants via pollinators such as bees, the preventative solution has been to use pesticides to avoid interaction between the bees and the affected crops.  To alleviate the spread of TMV while simultaneously preserving environmental safety, we looked into expressing the yeast gene, XRN1 in plants.  By producing the protein XRN1-p, yeast has a means of breaking down non-local and invasive RNA, a system that the eukaryotic N. Benthamiana does not have.  Ultimately, by expressing the yeast gene in our tobacco plants, we hope to both test whether it would successfully breakdown the viral RNA while also exploring whether yeast gene expression in plants is viable.",2019

In recent years, immunotherapy approaches such as CAR-T have emerged promising for cancer treatments. However, CAR-T has demonstrated limited effectiveness in treating solid tumors. The use of CAR-M therapy also presents certain limitations. Macrophages exhibit M1/M2 phenotypes. While macrophages in solid tumor are often being ""domesticated"" into the M2 phenotype. These anti-inflammatory macrophages further promote tumor development and contribute to cancer progression. Considering these challenges, our team has proposed SYN-MACRO (Synthetic engineering macrophage for Hepatocellular Carcinoma therapy) this year. We have engineered macrophages and designed a series of gene circuits to enable them to transition to the M1 phenotype upon tumor recognition, exerting a pro-inflammatory effect, recruiting other immune cells, and suppressing tumor development.

Scientists have managed to create different designs and have proposed several applications for this tool. However, all the programmable strands are synthesized by chemical reactions in laboratories. By inserting these stands into a plasmid, transforming a competent bacteria and incubating it with the helper phage, we propose a biological self-replicative and self-assembling way to produce a custom-shaped DNAbot.

Current HLB control methods include insecticides and antibiotics that present short-term solutions, that are not specific and may cause a negative impact in plants and the final product. The use of RNAi technology has been widely used in research of gene silencing. Team TEC CEM designed siRNAs targeting four different D. citri genes: Abnormal wing disc (Awd), Wingless (WNT), Superoxide dismutase 1 (CSD1) and Rac-like GTP-binding protein 1 (RacI) to prevent CLas infection and the spread of HLB.  RNAi has been proposed as a control mechanism for D. citri, but has only been tested using long dsRNA, therefore we developed siRNAs to maximize the specificity, reducing off-targeting.  To ensure effective delivery, siRNAs will be encapsulated using nanotechnology for their direct application to citrus plants.

One of the major mechanisms of bacterial resistance is that MDRB can produce beta-lactamases which degrade antibiotics, so finding new-type inhibitors is significant in the treatment of diseases associated with MDRB. Therefore, we focus our project on hitting Achilles' heel of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs), a vital class of beta-lactamases without available clinical inhibitors. We use synthetic biology methods to express a series of MBLs in E. coli, and then screen out effective inhibitor compounds via high-throughput screening with fluorescent probe (CDC-1) from several drug libraries. Also we assess their inhibitory ability in living bacterial cells by UV-vis. Our results shows that screened inhibitors improve the effect of beta-lactams when applied simultaneously to living bacteria, which are ideal candidates for therapeutics for diseases caused by MDRB.",2019

Because trehalose is a major termite blood sugar and trehalase is essential for trehalose metabolism, G3DH essentially converts trehalose into an insecticide. The pseudo-egg delivery system takes advantage of a habit termites have of carrying their eggs to their nests and licking them. Termites recognize their eggs by sensing &#946;-glucosidase and lysozyme, which act as egg-recognition pheromones. The pseudo eggs, containing both termite egg-recognition molecules and engineered E. coli, will be delivered to their nests and then licked by the termites present, thus allowing the  G3DH produced by the E. coli to convert trehalose into insecticide inside the termite bodies.

The activation of a kill-switch removes all individuals containing intact kill-switches from the population, leaving behind only individuals with defective kill-switches to found a new population. This project proposes an inducible plasmid-loss system to remove genetically engineered traits from a population without imposing selective pressure against the safeguard itself. The inducible plasmid-loss system is implemented by creating a plasmid containing CRISPR/Cas9, an RNA-guided nuclease system which targets and cleaves itself. A population containing this plasmid is expected to revert to wild-type upon activation. In addition to encouraging the application of evolutionary approaches to the field of synthetic biology, this project also contributes to making synthetic organisms safe for routine use outside the lab.

Recent efforts to address environmental pollution converge towards bioremediation as the most promising solution.

We did so by creating 2 plasmids that once co-transformed into E. coli would achieve the metabolization of toluene down to water and carbon dioxide. Additionally, a web application for visualizing, manipulating, and comparing genome-scale metabolic models of bacterial consortia was developed and used to analyse the introduction of our synthetic E. coli into the Athabasca river microbiome.

An economy of single-use plastics, commonly made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) due to its high crystallinity and resistance to degradation, has led to the production of millions of tons of plastic that is improperly disposed. Remarkably, an enzyme produced by Ideonella sakaiensis, termed PETase, can degrade this polymer at ambient temperatures. Combining the recent mutations derived from Austin et al., (2018) to increase the catalytic activity of PETase, our goal is to further optimize the thermostability and catalytic ability of PETase, through targeted mutagenesis, creating sequences using rational design and machine learning algorithms. With further optimization, we believe PETase may offer an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution to industrial plastic recycling efforts.

Because it induces the increased expression of growth related genes, oncogene amplification is one of the driving forces of cancer cell replication.  Recently, it was discovered that some oncogenes resided on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA). Like the DNA on chromosomes, ecDNAs are double stranded. A key difference, however, is the circular shape of ecDNAs; they are able to randomly distribute because they do not have centromeres, which increases heterogeneity in daughter cells. This can cause the cancerous tumors to develop faster resistance to current treatments. To target the ecDNA, we used CRISPR technology to create double strand breaks specifically in the ecDNA. Because ecDNA causes oncogene copy number to increase exponentially, utilizing CRISPR to create breaks in ecDNA decreases cancer cellsÂ’ replication speed.

Among the four canonical types, only group O is universally suitable for donation due to the absence of blood antigens on the surface of red blood cells.

In an attempt to address this issue and facilitate blood donations, our project aims to enzymatically convert type B blood into type A, which has successfully been converted into type 0 previously. This reaction is achieved by converting galactose as the terminal sugar of the B antigen into keto-galactose. Using molecular docking simulations with AlphaFold 2 enzyme structures, we screened monooxygenase families to identify enzymes that are potentially capable of catalyzing this conversion. Subsequently, activities of the selected enzymes were to be experimentally validated.

The system works by anchoring an enzyme of interest (EoI) onto the extracellular terminals of an outer membrane protein (OMP). As the cells grow, they will naturally shed their outer membrane as vesicles (OMV) containing OMP-EoI fusion. Due to OMVs being smaller than cells yet larger than free proteins, they can be separated from the bulk of protein impurities, simplifying the downstream processing. Once separated, the EoI may be released from the OMP by cleaving off a specific linker between the fusion with specific proteases.

Some azo-dyes, and their breakdown products, have proven to be of major environmental and health concern worldwide due to their mutagenic potential. The UCL 2014 team proposes harnessing various azo-dye degrading enzymes to create BioBricks for a novel Azo-Remediation Chassis (ARC). This would be capable of sensing, degrading, and decolourising azo-dyes, and ultimately detoxifying the breakdown products created. A bioprocess employing the ARC in an industrial setting has been developed and various modes of operation explored. This may serve as an end-of-pipe, lucrative addition to facilities expelling azo-dye contaminants. Furthermore, xenobiological approaches to biosafety are considered and a proposal for an Â“azotrophicÂ” organism paves the way for a new era in synthetic biology biosafety.",2014

The UCL iGEM team has developed novel synthetic psychobiotics that mimic these neuromodulatory strategies identified in endogenous intestinal strains.

We have designed safe therapeutic devices that target metabolic pathways for neurochemical biosynthesis. Additionally, we have assessed biocontainment and integrated a sensor detecting mood-related physiological changes in the gut environment.

In any year, mental health conditions affect one in four of us and available small molecule treatments have associated stigma and side effects. We believe that, besides aiding in the better understanding of the communication between gut microbiota and brain, our work will also lay a foundation for novel user-friendly treatments for mental health conditions.

To produce cement, fossil fuelled furnaces heat limestone to 1400 ÂºC to produce various calcium oxides, releasing 600 kg of CO2 for every tonne of cement produced. To tackle this challenge, we engineered Bacillus subtilis to overexpress urease and carbonic anhydrase enzymes. These enzymes produce carbonate ions from atmospheric or waste stream CO2, which when exposed to free calcium form stratified formation of calcite crystals at the bacterial cell outer surface. The precipitated crystalline calcium carbonate acts as the binding agent within our material, giving it properties comparable to concrete.

However, microcystins happen to be extremely stable, so this means they are able to resist common chemical breakdown, such as hydrolysis, at natural conditions. It also breaks down very slowly at high temperatures (40Â°C), so the best way to deal with the problem is to use a bacterium that can break it down. However they arenÂ’t usually found in water, so this allows the toxin to ravage the aquatic ecosystem.

We have expressed several permutations of the bacterial LUX metabolic pathway to empirically determine its rate limiting steps by measuring the resulting light production. The identification of rate-limiting steps then allows us to optimize the pathway. Furthermore, with these findings, an improved and experimentally validated mathematical model of the LUX pathway will be constructed.

This includes engineering large synthetic pathways and improving their expression. Overexpression of genes has hitherto mainly been achieved by using high or medium copy plasmids. However, studies have demonstrated that plasmid-bearing cells lose their productivity fairly quickly as a result of genetic instability. Therefore a new method was developed for the overexpression of a gene of interest in the bacterial chromosome: Chemically Inducible Chromosomal evolution (CIChE). In this technique the chromosome is evolved to contain a higher number of gene copies by adding a chemical inducer. The original model for CIChE, however, results in bacterial strains containing a large number of antibiotic resistance genes. To make this valuable technique more widely applicable in the industry, we developed a model for chromosomal evolution based on a toxin-antitoxin system instead of antibiotic resistance.",2013

This allows for an exclusively acellular delivery of the pheromone in the environment, making our solution safe and respectful towards bioethical standards. Ultimately, one could produce, extract and purify the pheromone for use in monitoring and prevention.

Our cells need to detect the PAHs for the degradation. But the molecules do not readily pass through the membrane. We solved this predicament by using one of the smaller PAHs as an indicator to degrade the heavier PAHs.  The degradation of this small PAH inside the cell relieves repression of genes under the control of the NahR/Psal promoter system. This causes a series of enzymes to get expressed and secreted outside the cell, oxidising and cleaving the ring structures of the carcinogenic compounds, making them available for downstream bio-degradation.

To effectively harness biological systems for addressing ongoing global challenges, rapid response is essential. ""SWIFT"" presents a groundbreaking approach to genetic circuit design, offering the necessary speed and scalability to meet society's evolving needs. It consists of three modules; MESA for detection and signal transductions, protease amplification for rapid and sufficient signal, inducible secretion for quick output of protein. We aim to cope CRS(Cytokine Release Syndrome) for the primary implementation. SWIFT for CRS detects the increase of cytokines in the blood and immediately secrete their inhibitors. In addition, we considered and designed several implementation beyond CRS. With SWIFT, we enables to detect soluble ligands and rapid produce of desired proteins.",2023

Potentially, routine diagnosis of the entire population can identify all virus carriers to block transmission.

To address this problem, we propose to develop a diagnostic platform that allows users to perform testing at home on a daily basis.

We designed a recombinant Escherichia coli strain capable of converting acetyl-CoA to acetone. The genetic modifications intend to integrate a plasmid carrying several genes of the ABE fermentation. We want to have acetone produced by bacteria in the intestines of the larvae. Here, it is supposed to help breaking down the plastic, because acetone can dissolve polystyrene.

We describe a method of early, accessible atherosclerosis detection: a lateral flow assay test strip that detects oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), a biomarker correlated with early and middle stages of atherosclerosis. Our device provides a rapid, proactive, point-of-care approach to evaluating atherosclerosis risk, allowing early treatment and potential reversal of disease. We employ SHuffle E. coli to produce anti-oxLDL antibodies that integrate into easy-to-read test strips to detect the presence of oxLDL in blood. Our device will provide a sorely-needed low-cost, early detection method for atherosclerosis, improving healthcare globally, especially for under-resourced communities.

Cellulitis is a common skin infection that occurs in the dermis. Oral and intravenous antibiotics are the standard treatment, because the upper skin layers serve as formidable barriers, rendering it difficult for topical treatments to reach the dermis. Instead, antibiotics travel through the circulatory system, leading to unfavorable interactions with the bodyÂ’s microbiome, causing patient discomfort and promoting antibiotic resistance. Therefore, we designed a topical treatment, NiSkin, that would traverse skin boundaries and specifically destroy the pathogens causing cellulitis. NiSkin combines the powerful lantibiotic nisin A and skin-penetrating peptide TD-1. NiSkin minimizes side effects and antibiotic resistance through selective activation at the infection site. We successfully co-expressed the nisin precursor conjugated to TD-1 alongside two enzymes that produce active nisin.

Therefore, it is possible to discriminate tumor cells from other tissue cells by detecting the low glucose concentration. Using liposome as a vector, we hope to design a drug expression system with the ability to respond to different glucose level. To achieve this, we combine the CRP activator, a regulatory protein activated by cAMP, with red fluorescent protein (RPF) as a reporter of expression level. Since glucose concentration is reversely related with cAMP level, a change of glucose level can influence the binding of CRP with target operon, thus altering the fluorescent intensity.

While Synthetic Biology has shown great potential in laboratory settings to address global environmental problems, deploying constructs effectively into messy, heterogeneous soil environments, where they must survive and express circuit genes, remains a significant challenge.  The overarching goal of our project is to address several impediments facing fieldable soil synthetic biology, including appropriate chassis selection, the presence of natural adversaries such as bacteriophage, and the largely dormant metabolic states of soil microbes.  We established Mycobacterium smegmatis as a soil synthetic biology chassis, characterized circuit-containing bacteria and phage in soil microcosms, employed multimodal measurement techniques, developed a novel mathematical model, and provided a comprehensive educational guidebook for future teams eager to pursue soil synthetic biology.

Dickeya fangzhongdai employs plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) and quorum sensing to initiate tissue degradation and disease development. By applying quorum quenching organisms capable of degrading AHL signals, the communication among bacteria can be hindered, effectively disrupting the production of PCWDEs. Additionally, the utilization of the aiiA gene encoding AHL lactonase allows for the degradation of AHL signaling molecules, further halting PCWDE production. This research project aims to protect orchid viability and agricultural productivity by offering a promising approach to combat Dickeya fangzhongdai.

Industries that would benefit from biomanufacturing of compounds via microorganisms include pharmaceuticals, cosmetics/fragrances, and other commercial industries. One molecule with potential applications in these fields is the monoterpenoid &#945;-terpineol. &#945;-Terpineol has been shown to have many medicinal and insecticidal properties. Here, we focused on biomanufacturing &#945;-terpineol as a potential mosquito repellant. Specifically, we aimed to produce &#945;-terpineol via de novo synthesis in Escherichia coli cells utilizing an inducible dual plasmid system. The engineered strain was produced by transforming one plasmid which contained the upstream enzymes of the mevalonate (MEV) pathway and a second plasmid which was constructed to contain the enzymes geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GPPS) and &#945;-terpineol synthase (&#945;TS). These enzymes convert the end products of the MEV pathway to &#945;-terpineol.

However, large-scale applications remain rare, as traditional production methods rely on extraction from plants and chemical synthesis. This makes monoterpenoid production expensive and unsustainable. Microbial production of monoterpenoids is a promising alternative, but poor precursor availability, complicated expression of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs), and product toxicity limit their potential. MonChassis is overcoming current limitations by increasing precursor availability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica by metabolic engineering, compartmentalization, and creating a cell-free, electrically-driven CYP system to circumvent product toxicity. With this, we established an adaptable platform for monoterpenoid production, allowing further deployment of monoterpenoids in unexplored areas. As a proof-of-concept , we produced verbenone, used to fight bark beetle invasion in forests locally, and globally. Thereby, MonChassis not only establishes a flexible production method for monoterpenoids without using plants but also contributes to the conservation of forests.

Many well-known methods, from traditional restriction digestion & ligation, 3A assembly to Gibson assembly, aim to overcome the difficulties but unfortunately get respective defects. This year, ZJU-CHINA seeks to build a gene-insertion system in bacterial chromosome, ""GeneSocket"". Clearly different from the in vitro constructing methods mentioned before, GeneSocket, which can be easily combined with existing in vitro methods, makes gene expression more accurate, stable and controllable by assembling genetic elements in chromosome directly.

Two core methods, lambda red recombination and recombinase-based bistable switch, are applied. Both are the best choices for achieving the characteristics of GeneSocket.

We hope that by using GeneSocket, synthetic biologists can turn their theoretical design into reality faster and better. We want to lead to the revolution in techniques of synthetic biology!",2014

We chose two kinds of toxins which are safe and environmentally friendly to eliminate termites. We have cloned genes coding insecticidal toxic proteins from Photorhabdus luminescens TT01, a bacteria poisonous to numerous insects, and express them in E.coli. We enhance the production of Avermectin in S.A. 

Then, we prepared cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) , and generated the nanofibrous microspheres (NCM) self-assembled from CNC as bacteria carriers, in order to reduce the loss, improve transport efficiency, and target the carrying to aimed location and preventing bacteria from releasing into the environment. 
Finally, a series of simulation experiments have been conducted. They can help us to understand  the  cellulase, and confirm the terminator are efficient. Based on the result of simulation, we improved a device to monitor and terminate termites for better achieving. ",2015

To solve the problem, our team designed and manufactured a set of household HPV detector for HPV early screening. Our detector will use female menstrual blood as teat sample and support two detection methods. The first method is based on CRISPR/Cas system. After rupturing the cervical epithelial cells in menstrual blood, we amplified the target with RPA, then identified it with Cas12a protein. This method is highly specific and can be used for HPV typing. However, in HPV screening, the key is to detect multiple HPV subtypes simultaneously. Therefore, to implement multi-channel detection, we designed another method. It uses Exo&#8546; to assist signal amplification and uses hybridization chain reaction to further amplify the signal. Both methods report the result using test paper. We have also designed three versions of PaDetector to better meet user needs.",2019

In an effort to overcome the unspecificity and side effect of the current contrast agent used for MRI, we reconstructure the magnetosomes from magnetotactic bacteria Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense to produce a contrast agent with high biocompatibility that specifically targets HER2 positive breast cancer cells. With biological modifications, magnetosomes can link with anti-HER2 antibodies. By antigen-antibody interaction, engineering magnetosomes can conjugated with HER2 positive breast cancer cells, demonstrating a special pattern on the image under magnetic field. Armed with our engineered contrast agent MagHER2some, the efficiency of evaluating the response of the treatment of HER2-postive breast cancer treatment can be optimized, thus assisting the progress of therapy process. Further application can be made through establishment of a platform with biomarkers targeting various diseases as inputs, paving avenue for precise evaluation of other diseases. ",2020

Previous studies have demonstrated that removal of senescent cells can reverse aging. Tissue fibrosis is a aging hallmark, characterized by senescent fibroblasts.
Furthermore, based on single-cell data analysis and immunochemistry, DPP4 were highly expressed on the surface of aged fibroblasts rather than on young fibroblasts. To address the concerns and reverse senescence-associated phenotypes, we designed a novel and efficient system for removal of these senescent fibroblasts with the help of assembled DPP4-targeting CAR-T immunotherapy. Due to the side effects of CAR-T system, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), we have also designed a negative feedback circuit with detecting the concentration of IL-6, markers of CRS. With the constant function of our project, anti-aging CAR-T, the harmful senescent fibroblasts are eradicated without severe side effects and the grand vision of rejuvenating with one shot will be realized.
