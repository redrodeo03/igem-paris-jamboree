1319,Aachen,Measurement,europe,Germany,RWTH Aachen University,collegiate,Cellock Holmes - a novel SynBio platform to detect pathogens,"Detection and identification of microbial contaminations on hard surfaces are vital to reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections and to alleviate the pressure on health care systems. Existing techniques pose limitations, as they do not combine effective, economical and rapid detection. The Cellock Holmes project aims to tackle these challenges all at once. By combining native microbial sensing systems, such as quorum sensing, with open source biology, hardware and software, a novel two-dimensional biosensor is developed. Cellock HolmesÂ’ simple, modular and open design enables the end user to test solid surfaces for microbial contamination without any expensive equipment or highly trained personnel. The working concept is demonstrated using one of the most prevalent human pathogens, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. The versatile biosensing system, however, can be easily customized to detect other pathogens as well.  ",2014

But as agreed on by various nations, we have to become independent from fossil resources during the next decades. As a consequence, not only fuels, but many other products including drugs, fine chemicals and plastic will have to be produced from renewable carbon sources. In parallel, we observe arable land per capita shrinking and more frequent droughts. But even by increasing agricultural productivity, plants will not be able to meet our massive demands. Therefore, we are developing an alternative route to sustainably produce complex carbon which significantly reduces the space and water needs. By using new synthetic pathways, we are upcycling a simple, renewable chemical into a universal carbon source. ",2015

We are modifying the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to increase the uptake of various ions into the cell and store these inside its vacuole. This will be achieved by upregulation of native (vacuolar) ion importers and knock-out of ion exporters. Furthermore, we are expressing heterologous genes from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in yeast to improve vacuolar ion accumulation, thus creating a microbial dustbin.
With this newly generated library of genetically engineered yeasts, we hope to offer a novel way of treating water contaminated by industrial processes and store pollutants in our intracellular reservoir, the Salt Vault. Then this concept can be employed by industries facing problems with high pollution in their process water.",2017

",collegiate,Plastractor - extracting microplastics from fluids via magnets,"Nowadays the problem of microplastics in fluids like drinkable water is a huge topic with a lot of new publications and studies about the amount, types and risks of it for animals, environment and humans. The ""Plastractor"" is a device which shall extract microplastics from fluids easily via magnets. Therefore the bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum ""magneticum"" was obtained. It is genetically modified to build magnetosomes; small magnetic and vesicle-like particles, with plastic binding peptides on its membrane. For modification we use E. coli BW29427 which transfers the needed plasmid to Rhodospirillum rubrum ""magneticum"" via conjugation. Two different plastic binding peptides are used, ""Tachystatin A2"" (TA2) and ""liquid chromatography peak I"" (LCI), fused with two different fluorescent proteins to enable the detection of the bound particles. Thus the device will be able to extract the plastics that are bound to magnetosomes and detect it by fluorescence.

With M.A.R.S., we want to establish an innovative strategy to create light-powered, mitochondrion-like protocells and a bioreactor that will recycle those cells by magnetism. Through the design of our reusable recycling system it will be able to power every ATP-driven enzyme cascade, making M.A.R.S. universally applicable. By extracting bacteriorhodopsin out of Halobacterium salinarum, a phototrophic archaea species, and combining it with an ATP synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in self-produced polymersomes and liposomes, we get simple but effective chassis, which make it possible to cover the energy requirement of any enzyme reaction cascade. Binding those chassis to magnet particles via anchor peptides enables the reuse of the entire protocell system within the reactor by means of magnetic purification, whereby they can be fed directly into enzyme cascades, without depending on living cells.",2020

https://www.rwth-aachen.de",collegiate,Enzyme-based semi-specific DNA synthesis for long-term data storage ,"In the last few years,&#8239;DNA&#8239;sequencing has developed rapidly while DNA synthesis still relies on the decades-old&#8239;chemical phosphoramidite system. However, this process is toxic and has already reached its limit at around 200 bases. Thus, the demand for more environmentally friendly and effective novel approaches is evident. In this project, we report an enzymatic ssDNA synthesis system with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). In each synthesis cycle, an unspecific number of nucleotides is incorporated. Our unique automated hardware can selectively attach nucleotides to immobilized primers in order to synthesize preset DNA sequences. We present a ternary system to encode and recover the information stored on DNA. This system enables the semi-specific approach, in which information is saved only in the transitions between bases, therefore specific synthesis is not necessary. This opens up a much more approachable and robust system that even allows adding proof-reading properties.",2021

Regarding the decreasing rate of phosphate mining and the waste of phosphate in wastewater, there will soon not be enough to sustain a civilization of ten billion people. Up until now, there is no efficient solution to regain phosphate from wastewater. If humanity fails to recycle phosphate, we will have a wide range of challenges. One problem is the pollution of soils and water with high amounts of phosphate from agricultural and industrial waste. Furthermore, the need for phosphate fertilizers will only grow as the earthÂ’s population grows. MEtaPhos aims to revolutionize the phosphate cycle by fusing a phosphate-binding protein with a molecular optogenetic switch. By blue light irradiation, we can control the binding and release of phosphate in a highly specific manner. Our goal is to recycle phosphate from wastewater and generate polyphosphate to be reused in the industry.

By utilizing the mechanisms of the lambda repressor, we are able to switch between the expressions of three different genes with a short delay. This kind of mechanism provides a nearly real-time control over genes, which could provide advantages in variety of industrial bioprocesses.

Inspired by the principles of open source software, we introduce an Open Sequence business model implemented around our switch. We want to encourage future companies to create Open Sequence based solutions and to empower customers to participate in the product development. Open Sequence modelÂ’s transparency as well as lower degree of protection raises trust and continuity and benefits larger community.

University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland",collegiate,Fuel for the Future: E. coli producing renewable propane from cellulose,"Climate change is argued to be one of the greatest challenges faced by mankind. Its primary cause is believed to be man-made CO2 emissions from transportation and electricity production. To tackle the issue of transportation emissions, we want to produce sustainable propane in Escherichia coli using cellulosic feedstock. The pathway is a patchwork of 10 different enzymes from different organisms, such as Mycobacterium marinum and Bacillus subtilis. We built a model of the pathway to identify its bottlenecks and concentrate our engineering efforts on them. To elevate our propane from a food crop -based  first generation biofuel to the second generation, we are integrating a secretion system for cellulose hydrolysing enzymes. To innovatively enhance our production system, we are bringing the two final enzymes of our pathway into close proximity by fusing them with micelle-forming amphiphilic proteins. This increases theoretical yield, bringing us one step closer to commercially viable biopropane.",2015

Currently, antibiotics are among the most common acne treatments. However, 50% of bacteria associated with acne are already resistant to the antibiotics used. Our project aims to develop a novel treatment for acne using an antimicrobial peptide, dermcidin, naturally found in human sweat. Dermcidin has shown to be active against Propionibacterium acnes, the bacterium associated with acne.  Patients with acne also have reduced expression of dermcidin, which suggests that it might contribute to the condition. We aim to produce dermcidin tied to a cellulose-binding domain, which would enable the immobilization of the peptide on a cellulose surface. This would allow the usage of dermcidin in various skin care products, such as hydrogel masks and exfoliation pads.

Our iGEM project introduces VibXPRESSO - Vibrio natriegens with Xtreme PRotein Expression and Secretion Optimization. We harness the gram-negative bacterium's generation time of under 10 minutes to rapidly produce large amounts of protein for efficient purification. This is achieved via the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway, that secretes proteins into the bacterium's periplasm. By environmental modifications we have increased the outer membrane leakiness of  V. natriegens, to direct proteins from the periplasm into the growth medium for easier protein harvest. As a proof of concept, we compared the yield of human growth hormone between V. natriegens WT ATCC 14048 and our modified VibXPRESSO strain.",2019

",collegiate,SINISENS - A step towards cleaner waters,"The presence of macrolide antibiotics in nature is a growing concern as they have been on the 'watch-list' of pharmaceuticals for EU-wide monitoring in aquatic environments for several years. They can be harmful for the environment and human health because they are persistent and can remain biologically active. Additionally, they may promote the development of antimicrobial resistance. According to various experts, there will likely be regulations regarding the monitoring of macrolide antibiotics in the near future. However, current methods for measuring them are time-consuming, expensive and require expertise. Our solution, SINISENS, is designed to aid wastewater treatment plants to monitor the concentrations of macrolide antibiotics and could be used to optimize the removal process. SINISENS is an optical on-site biosensor based on a genetic circuit that utilises a transcription factor called MphR to detect macrolide antibiotics. In the presence of these compounds, SINISENS produces green fluorescence as an output signal.",2020

However, reliable measurements of these compounds are a major drawback for a better understanding of the connection between the gut microbiota and the brain. GutLux, our ingestible biosensor, tackles this by measuring the concentration of the metabolites in vivo, inside the gut. GutLux is comprised of two parts. The biological component responds to the concentration of metabolite by producing a light signal that can be measured quantitatively. The electronic component measures this signal and converts it to readable, wirelessly transmittable data. Our design focuses on compounds associated with mental health, but its use could be extended to other gut metabolites by adapting the biological component. In addition, we have devoted ourselves to create awareness of the importance of the gut microbiota in our wellbeing and its impact on mental health.",2021

www.helsinki.fi",collegiate,Qblock - preventing biofilm formation by quorum quenching,"Chronic wounds are a ""hidden epidemic"" that place an undue strain on patients and the healthcare system. They often arise as a secondary complication of more persistent health problems. Biofilms are present around 80% of chronic wounds and contribute to their slowed healing. Our project, QBlock, is intended to limit biofilm formation by targeting bacterial communication molecules (i.e. AIPs) that contribute to biofilm formation in Staphylococcus epidermidis by impeding the bacterial communication via DARPins (designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins), which are synthetic proteins mimicking antibodies. A DNA library of 42 DARPins was generated by altering and randomizing amino acid positions. AlphaFold2 predicted the structure of these DARPins, and the affinity of DARPins towards AIP was experimentally measured via ribosomal display. Control experiments employed a GFP-binding DARPin with a known sequence. Structural predictions and modeling not only confirmed a significant binding with AIP, but also highlighted the diversity and heterogeneity of DARPins.
